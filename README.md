# Machine-Learning-Classifiers

Machine Learning Classifier. This is an attempt to implement popular, classic or well known machine learning classifiers
such as image classifier, etc. This starting classifier is a K-Nearest Neighbor, implemented in Python. 

NOTE: Nearest Neighbors: 

k - # of neighbors in the training data. Imagine you have two classes, class A and class B. If there exist a point between two classes, how do we classify that point? To which class? In this case, the KNN plays an important role. Classification is then done by voting i.e determining the closest points to the point to classify, using Euclidean distance theorems.
